# CS50X Miami App

This is an app for our final project out of CS50X Miami. The point of this app is to create a local place where students can access links needed for the class. Some of the links would be to our attendance, class lecture videos, source codes, etc. Our aim is to have this app available on mobile but if not, a desktop app.
